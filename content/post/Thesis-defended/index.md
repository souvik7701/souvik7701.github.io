## Thesis Defense ðŸŽ‰

I successfully **defended my undergraduate thesis** on **March 18, 2025**.  

### **Extended Abstract**

**Abstract**  
Lysine (K) succinylation is a post-translational modification that can severely influence various cellular activities and has been linked to several diseases by recent research.  
In this study, we propose a novel ResNet-based architecture, **ResLysEmbed**, for lysine succinylation site prediction that uses word embeddings along with per-residue embeddings from a protein language model. Furthermore, we applied **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** analysis to interpret how much each residue within the 33-length window around the target site contributes to succinylation prediction.
