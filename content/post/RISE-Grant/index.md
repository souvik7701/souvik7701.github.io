## Exciting News 🎉

I am thrilled to share that I have received the **RISE Student Research Grant (BDT 49,613)** from the **Research and Innovation Centre for Science and Engineering (RISE), BUET**.

The grant is awarded for my undergraduate thesis project:

**“Structural-Embedding Fusion for Improved Succinylated Lysine Site Prediction.”**

This funding will support the research, development, and experiments necessary to enhance the accuracy of predicting succinylated lysine sites using advanced structural and embedding-based techniques.

Special thanks to my supervisor and everyone who supported me in this journey! 🙌
