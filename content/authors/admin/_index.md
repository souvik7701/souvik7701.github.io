        We developed **ResLysEmbed**, a ResNet+MLP-based hybrid model that integrates word and protein language model embeddings to predict lysine succinylation sites with superior accuracy and interpretability. It outperforms existing methods and provides biologically relevant insights through SHAP analysis. Supervised by [Prof Dr. Mohammad Saifur Rahman](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_detail/mrahman). Our work later got acccepted in Bioinformatics Advances.

      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
